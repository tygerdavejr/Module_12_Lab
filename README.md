# Module_12_Lab
Create a pet class

This lab requires us to build a module to create a Pet Class, to include the pet's name, type, and age.

Once the class is designed, the rest of the module needs to create an object of the class and prompt the user for information
to be stored in that object.  Finally, this information needs to be accessed through the object's accesssor methods and displayed
to the screen.

Output needs to be similar to the following:

Enter your pet's name:
Min
Enter your pet's type:
Bird
Enter your pet's age:
6
Your pet name: Min
Your pet type: Bird
Your pet age: 6

The pseudocode for the exercise is so bogged down in Java terms to be nearly useless.
